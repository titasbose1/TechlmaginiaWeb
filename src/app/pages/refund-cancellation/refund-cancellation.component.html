  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policies</h1>

  <p>
    At Techlmaginia Softwares Private Limited, we aim to provide clear and fair
    refund and cancellation policies. The following outlines the standard
    practices; specific terms may vary per agreement or product.
  </p>

  <h2>Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    Refunds may be issued at our discretion for purchases made through official
    channels. Refund eligibility depends on the product type, usage, and the
    terms agreed at the time of purchase.
  </p>

  <h2>Cancellations</h2>
  <p>
    Cancellation requests should be sent to our support team. For subscription
    services, cancellations will stop future billing but may not retroactively
    refund prior billing periods unless otherwise agreed.
